# 📝 To-Do List App
[Click here to view the app](https://saira-code.github.io/to-do-app/)

A simple and stylish To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
You can add tasks, delete them manually, or simply check them off to have them automatically removed from your list.  
All tasks are saved in **Local Storage**, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

**1. What did you learn while making this app?**  
I learned how to use JavaScript to dynamically create, remove, and store elements, as well as how to save and load data from Local Storage for persistence.

**2. What feature did you enjoy building the most?**  
I really enjoyed building the automatic task removal feature when a checkbox is ticked, as it makes the app feel fast and satisfying to use.

**3. What would you add next if you had more time?**  
I would add categories, due dates, and maybe a dark mode to make the app more functional and customizable.
